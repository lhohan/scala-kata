scala-kata
==========

Kata : practice coding by doing it repetitively. In this instance: keep on practicing Scala.

Intention is to keep the kata small and short at first, very basic and below 30 min time in total so they can be performed regularly.


If you want to read up on what kata are or why they may be interesting, check out for example:
  * [Using Katas To Improve](http://blog.8thlight.com/chong-kim/2013/09/26/using-katas-to-improve.html)
  * [CodeKata] (http://codekata.com/) by Dave Thomas

With this project I aim to make exercising as easy as possible by:
  * provide a template with failing tests and provide empty methods to be implemented to make the tests succeed
  * keep a short feedback loop while implementing, immediate feedback keeps you going

Note: the tests will probably be quite basic and it is not their intention to test all corner cases extensively. The goal is simply to have a feedback loop and a correct implementation is still the responsibility of  the implementer.

How to
------
Only pre-requisite: you will need to have [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed.

  * clone this project
  * start 'sbt' in project directory
  * 'projects' will show all available katas
  * you can choose to run all kata or switch to a specific kata project, e.g. 'project kata01'
  * run '~test'
  * all tests will be failing --> make them pass :-)
  * open up class kata.Kata in src/main/scala in your favorite IDE or editor
  * start implementing the methods
  * every time you switch to sbt you will see the current result of your passing and failing tests
  * to stop the sbt tests: just hit enter in sbt

Kata
-----------

First the Kata will be focused on simple tests to keep on practicing language constructs mostly. Depending on experiences I'll adapt.

Input initially will be my own studying: things I think will be interesting for me to keep on remembering and practicing (books, article, courses), [99 problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/), the Euler project, etc. .

Will see. Lets first get something basic working first.
